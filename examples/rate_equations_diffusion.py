# This example demonstrates the RateEquationsWithDiffusion class.
# This solves the rate equations for the ionisation stages of
# a given species evolving at different constant temperatures and 
# fixed density. There is diffusion of all ionisation stages out of the system, 
# and replacement by neutrals, such that the total number of 
# ions stays fixed over time at 1.0.
#
# plots are shown of the time history of the stages at roughly 10eV,
# and also of the final state (after 1 second) of the ions for the various temperatures.
